        <!-- Project 1: TryHackMe Labs -->
        <article>
            <h3>Cybersecurity Training - TryHackMe (In Progress)</h3>
            <p>Hands-on labs in vulnerability identification, network scanning, and penetration testing exercises. Through platforms like TryHackMe, I am actively learning to identify and resolve security issues in real-world scenarios.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> Kali Linux, Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Getting accustomed to penetration testing tools and network configurations.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution/Outcome:</strong> Enhanced my skills in network scanning and exploiting vulnerabilities. Successfully completed labs on firewall evasion, packet sniffing, and gaining root access to target machines.</p>

        <!-- Project 2: Home Lab Setup -->
        <article>
            <h3>Home Lab Setup (In Progress)</h3>
            <p>I built a virtualized home lab to simulate real-world IT environments. The lab allows me to practice system administration, network security, and automation in a controlled environment.</p>
            <p><strong>Technologies Used:</strong> VMware, pfSense, Docker, Linux</p>
            <p><strong>Challenges:</strong> Setting up secure networking and automating network monitoring for vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p><strong>Solution/Outcome:</strong> Configured firewalls, network segmentation, and automated backups in the lab. The home lab also provides hands-on experience with network configuration and cloud services.</p>
